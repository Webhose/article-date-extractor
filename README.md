## About Webz.io


At [Webz.io](https://webz.io) we crawl, structure, unify and aggregate data from millions of online sources (news sites, blogs, discussion forums, comments etc..), so the need for a
scalable solution that will automatically extract and structure the unstructured web is critical. We use multiple signals and algorithms to automatically detect where the post text is, the author name, the comments,
and of course the date. With articleDateExtractor (Article Date Extractor) we rely on the many "different types of standards" out there to automatically detect the date (with a success rate of over 90%).
